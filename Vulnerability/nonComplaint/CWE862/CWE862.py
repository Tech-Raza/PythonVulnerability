class CWE862:

    def get_data(self):
        response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
        return response.text
    # In this example, the get_data function retrieves data from an API endpoint using the requests library. However,
    # the API endpoint does not require any authorization or authentication, which is a vulnerability because an
    # attacker could easily access the data without proper permission.
